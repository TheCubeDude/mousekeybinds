# mousekeybinds

[Download for Windows](https://github.com/TheCubeDude/mousekeybinds/releases/latest/download/binds.exe)

This program lets mouse clicks be bound to key presses. As of the current version, it's designed primarily with Magic Cube 7D functionality in mind.

How to bind a key:
1. Press Ctrl-B
2. Move the cursor to the desired position
3. Press the desired key
This will create two keybinds for the key. The first is the specified key by itself, which clicks the specified position. The second is Shift + the specified key, which holds 2, clicks the specified position, then releases 2.

As of the current version, editing keybinds is not possible, so if you make an error, close the program and reopen it.

Planned features:

Ability to unbind keys

Automatic piece filter configuration keybind support

Support for other mouse-controlled hypercubing programs, such as Magic Cube 4D, Magic Cube 5D, Magic Puzzle Ultimate, and Magic Tile.

Single key press binds

Presets
